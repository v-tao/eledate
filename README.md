# eledate

Eledate is a video-based dating app for users over the age of 18. To set up an account, users create a 15 second elevator pitch giving insight into themselves as a potential dating candidate. Users can then swipe right or left on other candidates depending on their preference. If two users both swipe right on each other, they will be matched and can then message each other.
